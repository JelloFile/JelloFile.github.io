    <h2>Our Privacy Policy</h2><br>
   <p style='width:200px'>We, at JelloHub know you care about your privacy, and we do too. We appreciate for you putting your trust in us. This Privacy Policy describes how JelloHub uses your data. By using our "Services", or as we commonly refer to them, "Projects", you are agreeing to the practices listed in this Privacy Policy.</p><br><br><h2>1. Cookies/Local Storage</h2><br><p style='width:200px;'>In our projects, we usually use something called cookies/local storage. In short, these are usually used to store data. In our projects, we do not store any personal data, but for a precaution, we have included them. In our projects, we store attributes such as project data, like coins. We do not store ANY personal data, unless you willingly give it to us. In the JelloHub main site, we also do not collect any Personal Data. This may change in the near future, if we ever add a login page, but in the current state, we do not collect data through any of our projects using cookies/localStorage. </p><p>We do not have any other stuff here, due to us actually not collecting any data from the user-end experience.</p>
